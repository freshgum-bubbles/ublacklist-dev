# freshgum's blocklist
# ====================
#
# This is a collection of websites to block via the uBlacklist extension.
# The extension removes filtered websites from search engine results pages (SERPs for short.)
# Various lists exist for the extension, of which this is one.
#
# I have published this in the hopes that you, or someone else, finds it useful.
# It is a culmination of many hours of internet usage, wherein I have periodically
# found an undesirable website, and have chosen to add it to this list.
#
# As always, please exercise caution when adding filter lists to your extensions.
# I have no way of proving I added these websites without any form of bias,
# financial or otherwise -- my word is the best I can offer.
#
# However, in the hopes of making sense of some of these blocks years later,
# I have attached semi-detailed reasoning to each filtered website.
#
# Any usage of filter lists runs the risk of hiding information you may want to 
# access, and should this list become out-of-date, you may find that the domains 
# below may now host content which positively contributes to the internet, 
# as opposed to detracting from it.
#
# With the above out of the way, please note that this content is licensed

#
# Please remember to periodically update your filter lists, as uBlacklist 
# currently lacks an automated, uBO-esque way of doing this.
