A collection of personally-maintained, up-to-date [uBlacklist](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/docs) 
lists for removing certain types of content from search results.

- [`rules_developer.txt`](./rules_developer.txt): a rule list specifically oriented
  towards reducing developer-focused spam, such as SEO forms designed to appear in
  search results for common problems and search queries (e.g. *"what is Error in JavaScript"*).
